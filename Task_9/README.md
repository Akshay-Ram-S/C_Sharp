## Reflection and Custom Attributes

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build an application that discovers and executes methods based on custom attributes using reflection in C#.

## Concepts Learned

Attributes : Attributes provide a powerful way to associate metadata, or declarative information, with code (assemblies, types, methods, properties, and so on). After you associate an attribute with a program entity, you can query the attribute at run time by using a technique called reflection.
<br><br>
Reflection : Reflection objects are used for obtaining type information at runtime. The classes that give access to the metadata of a running program are in the System.Reflection namespace.
<br><br>

Steps to be followed for custom attribute :

1. Define the custom attribute.
   <br>
2. Create classes with methods marked with attributes.
   <br>
3. Use reflection to find and invoke methods.
   <br>
4. Invoke the methods.
   <br><br>

Some classes under Reflection are :

1. Type
   <br>
2. MemberInfo
   <br>
3. MethodInfo
   <br>
4. ConstructorInfor
   <br>
5. FieldInfo

## Generics and Interfaces with a Repository PatternObjective

## Objective

Implement a generic in-memory repository using the repository pattern to perform CRUD operations with a simple console UI demonstration.

## Concepts Learned

1. Repository Pattern: A design pattern that abstracts data access logic, providing a clean separation between the business logic and data access layer.
   <br>
2. Generics: Allows the creation of classes, interfaces, and methods that work with any data type, promoting code reusability and type safety.
   <br>
3. Interfaces: Define a contract that classes must implement, ensuring consistency in method signatures and behavior across different implementations.

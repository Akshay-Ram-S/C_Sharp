## Asynchronous Programming and Multi-threading

## Objective

To demonstrate concurrent asynchronous operations in C# with simulated API calls, result aggregation, and exception handling.

## Concepts Leaned

In C#, async and await are keywords that enable asynchronous programming. async marks a method as asynchronous, while await pauses an async method until a task is complete.
<br>
In C#, the task is used to implement Asynchronous Programming, i.e., executing operations asynchronously.
<br>
Task.Delay() - Creates a task that completes after a specified time interval.
<br>
Task.WhenAll() runs all tasks concurrently and waits for their completion.

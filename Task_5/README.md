## File I/O and Exception Handling

## Objective

Develop a file-based application to read, process (count words/lines), and write data with proper exception handling for file-related errors.

## Concepts Learned

File Handling:

Learned about file methods such as Create(), Open(), Copy(), Exists() and much more.

StreamReader: used to read characters from byte stream

StreamWriter: used to write characters to a stream
<br><br>
Exception Handling : Exceptions are handled using try and catch block.
<br><br>
Some File Exceptions:

1. FileNotFoundException: Exception thrown when we try to access a file which doesn't exist.

2. IOException: Exception thrown when I/O error occurs.

3. FileLoadException: Exception when a file is found but cannot be loaded.
